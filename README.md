This repository is to share my workings as a Python Programming Intern in the Virtual Internship Program at Oasis Infobytes in he month of October 2023. In this internship, I choose to work on the level 1 in which I have to complete the following tasks: IDE:- VS Code Technologies:- Python Programming(For Hosting) 

This description is written in Markdown, which is commonly used on GitHub for documentation. It provides detailed instructions on how to use the BMI calculator, the BMI categories, and encourages contributions or feedback from other users.

Task 1: This command-line BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator prompts users to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).It then calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).The calculated BMI is then categorized into predefined ranges representing different weight status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.
The code follows these steps:
Prompt the user to enter their weight and height. Validate the input to ensure it is a valid numerical value.Calculate the BMI using the provided formula.Categorize the BMI into predefined ranges and determine the corresponding weight status.Display the calculated BMI and weight status to the user.

Task 2:This Python script implements a basic voice assistant capable of performing simple tasks based on voice commands. The assistant responds to common greetings like "Hello" with predefined responses, tells the current time or date upon request, and can perform basic web searches for information based on user queries.
Features
1. Greeting Responses:
   - When the user says "Hello" or a similar greeting, the assistant responds with a predefined friendly message.
2. Time and Date Information:
   - Upon receiving a command like "What's the time?" or "Tell me the date," the assistant provides the current time or date.
3. Web Search:
   - The assistant can search the web for information based on user queries. For example, saying "Search for Python programming" triggers a web search for information on Python programming.

Task 3:This Python script serves as a command-line password generator, allowing users to generate random passwords based on their specified criteria. Users can define the length of the password and choose which character types to include (letters, numbers, symbols). The generator ensures the creation of strong and secure passwords by providing flexibility in customization.
1. Password Length:
   - Users can specify the length of the generated password.
2. Character Set Preferences:
   - Users can choose to include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols in their passwords.
3. Secure and Randomized Generation:
   - The script uses the `secrets` module to ensure secure and cryptographically strong randomization in password generation.
